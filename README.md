# SeleniumPractice-CLI
Just like the name says, this is my first crack at Selenium. 
It doesn't seem hard to get so this should be easy.
It makes me wonder about the need for a great deal of experience with this code when listing it as a job requirement.
Considering it is open source and can be used in any way the programmer decides it seems likely any team one might work for 
and get the 2+ years experience that is often asked for they may come to find the new team they join does things very differently.
